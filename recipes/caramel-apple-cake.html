        Sweet tender spiced apples make up the base of the cake with swirls of
        sweet caramel throughout
      </h2>
      <p>
        Warm, spicy apples with a buttery, crunchy topping. This screams fall!
        This is so easy and quick and sure to be a crowd pleaser. This would be
        delicious with vanilla ice cream and maybe top with more of the caramel
        sauce.

        <li>2 (21 ounce) cans apple pie filling</li>
        <li>Â½ cup caramel sauce</li>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package spice cake mix</li>

        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
          9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spread apple pie filling in an even layer on the bottom of the pan.
          Drizzle caramel sauce evenly over apples. Sprinkle cake mix evenly
          over apples and caramel. Drizzle melted butter evenly over cake mix.
          Sprinkle evenly with chopped walnuts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until cake is golden brown and the filling
          is bubbling through to the top, 50 to 55 minutes. Let cool at least 15
          minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
